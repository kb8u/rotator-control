rotator-control
===============

Control M-squared azimuth rotators on a linux computer by double-clicking on
a map, entering a grid square or a callsign prefix.  See the help menu for
adding maps.

This program requires a bunch of perl modules to be installed first.  There
is no binary executable at this time.

Allow your user ID to access the serial port
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER

Download rotator-control to a directory of your choosing and run
`chmod 555 rotator-control` to make it executable.
